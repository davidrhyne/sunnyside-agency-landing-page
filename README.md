## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-guidelin.es/) -  Sass makes CSS fun again.
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use Sass and many of its core features like variables, functions, and mixins.  Likewise, I learn how to use partials and how to implement them with the @use and @forward methods.  

While they were not new topics, I got some really good practice at using absolute and relative positioning.  I must admit that I had only used them in very limited capacities before, but it seemed nature to used that method of the navigation menu and the services section (text overlayed on images).

### Continued development

This was my first solo project using Sass and it will not be the last.  For the next project, I will try to implement the 7-1 pattern, or something very similar. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn Sass in this Free Crash Course - Give your CSS Superpowers! by DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roywYSEPSvc) - This video by Gary at DesignCourse was a good re-introduction to Sass and covers all the basics with simple examples.
- [Get your stylesheets more organized with Sass partials by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ld-aOKsEDk) - I really like Kevin Powell and his teaching style.  I used this and 3-4 of Kevin's videos on Sass and found them quick and to the point.  I particularily liked the videos on starting projects with Sass, howe to organize files, using partials, and using @use/@forward instead of the @import.
- [Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers by codeSTACKr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - This was a great video covering the fundamentals for Sass, hosted by freeCodeCamp.org.
